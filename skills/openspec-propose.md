Propose a new change — create the change and generate artifacts (mode depends on schema).

**MVDS:** Two schemas exist: **`mvds-default`** (default — see `openspec/config.yaml`) and **`experiment-hub-lite`** (archived hub mirror, selectable per-change). Do not pass `--schema bhd-experiment` / `experiment-hub` / `quickstart` until those schemas exist under `openspec/schemas/`.

**`mvds-default` (default):** one artifact per approval turn — proposal → specs → **discovery** (0.0 As-is → 0.5 Eval → 0.6 Eval Summary) → design (1.0 conditioned on the approved summary; 1.5 Eval Delta) → tasks. Human anchor required before proposal. `experiment-hub-lite` runs the same flow without the discovery stage.

When ready to implement, run /opsx:apply

**Input**: The user's request should include a change name (kebab-case) OR a description of what they want to build.

**Steps**

1. **If no clear input provided, ask what they want to build**

   Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** (open-ended, no preset options) to ask:

   > "What change do you want to work on? Describe what you want to build or fix."

   From their description, derive a kebab-case name (e.g., "add user authentication" → `add-user-auth`).

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT proceed without understanding what the user wants to build.

2. **Create the change directory**

   ```bash
   openspec new change "<name>"
   ```

   This creates a scaffolded change at `openspec/changes/<name>/` with `.openspec.yaml` using the **default schema** from `openspec/config.yaml` (**`mvds-default`**).

3. **Get the artifact build order**

   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```

   Parse the JSON to get:
   - `applyRequires`: array of artifact IDs needed before implementation (e.g., `["tasks"]`)
   - `artifacts`: list of all artifacts with their status and dependencies

4. **Lite schema gate (when `schemaName` is `mvds-default` or `experiment-hub-lite`)**

   Before creating `proposal`:
   - Require **Human anchor** — founder quote verbatim. If missing, ask for it; do not invent anchor-only prose.
   - **One artifact per user turn:** create only the next `ready` artifact, show it, **stop and wait for approval** before the next (do not batch proposal + specs + design + tasks in one response).

5. **Create artifacts in sequence until apply-ready**

   Use the **TodoWrite tool** to track progress through the artifacts.

   **Lite:** stop after each artifact (step 4).

   Loop through artifacts in dependency order (artifacts with no pending dependencies first):

   a. **For each artifact that is `ready` (dependencies satisfied)**:
   - Get instructions:
     ```bash
     openspec instructions <artifact-id> --change "<name>" --json
     ```
   - The instructions JSON includes:
     - `context`: Project background (constraints for you - do NOT include in output)
     - `rules`: Artifact-specific rules (constraints for you - do NOT include in output)
     - `template`: The structure to use for your output file
     - `instruction`: Schema-specific guidance for this artifact type
     - `outputPath`: Where to write the artifact
     - `dependencies`: Completed artifacts to read for context
   - Read any completed dependency files for context
   - Create the artifact file using `template` as the structure
   - Apply `context` and `rules` as constraints - but do NOT copy them into the file
   - Show brief progress: "Created <artifact-id>"

   b. **Continue until all `applyRequires` artifacts are complete**
   - After creating each artifact, re-run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json`
   - Check if every artifact ID in `applyRequires` has `status: "done"` in the artifacts array
   - Stop when all `applyRequires` artifacts are done

   c. **If an artifact requires user input** (unclear context):
   - Use **AskUserQuestion tool** to clarify
   - Then continue with creation

6. **Show final status**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>"
   ```

**Output**

After completing all artifacts, summarize:

- Change name and location
- List of artifacts created with brief descriptions
- What's ready: "All artifacts created! Ready for implementation."
- Prompt: "Run `/opsx:apply` to implement tasks" after all applyRequires artifacts are done and approved.

**Artifacts output (required):** Follow [`skills/openspec-artifacts-output.md`](openspec-artifacts-output.md). After **each** artifact write (lite: every approval turn), end the message with `## Artifacts` linking files touched that turn. When all `applyRequires` artifacts are `done`, list every artifact file for the change (from `openspec status --change "<name>" --json`).

**Artifact Creation Guidelines**

- Follow the `instruction` field from `openspec instructions` for each artifact type
- The schema defines what each artifact should contain - follow it
- Read dependency artifacts for context before creating new ones
- Use `template` as the structure for your output file - fill in its sections
- **IMPORTANT**: `context` and `rules` are constraints for YOU, not content for the file
  - Do NOT copy `<context>`, `<rules>`, `<project_context>` blocks into the artifact
  - These guide what you write, but should never appear in the output

**Guardrails**

- **mvds-default / experiment-hub-lite:** Human anchor non-empty; max 2 capabilities in proposal; max 5 requirements in specs; one artifact per approval; load `skills/<skill>.md` per schema `instruction` in `openspec instructions` JSON; prefer AGENTS.md over hub paths in copied voice skills. mvds-default additionally: eval in an isolated subagent, rubric from the manifest only, findings ledger over scores, delta informational
- Create ALL artifacts needed for implementation (as defined by schema's `apply.requires`) — but for lite, only one per approval turn
- Always read dependency artifacts before creating a new one
- If context is critically unclear, ask the user - but prefer making reasonable decisions to keep momentum
- If a change with that name already exists, ask if user wants to continue it or create a new one
- Verify each artifact file exists after writing before proceeding to next
