Propose a new change — create the change and generate artifacts (mode depends on schema).

**`experiment-hub-lite` (default):** one artifact per approval turn — proposal → specs → design → tasks. Human anchor required before proposal.

**`bhd-experiment`:** one artifact per approval turn — explore → propose → apply → archive. Do **not** create `proposal.md`, `specs/`, `design.md`, or `tasks.md`. Code ships via a child change with `experiment-hub-lite`. See `rules/bhd-experiment.mdc`.

**Other schemas:** may batch all artifacts in one step unless instructions say otherwise.

When ready to implement, run /opsx:apply

---

**Input**: The user's request should include a change name (kebab-case) OR a description of what they want to build.

**Steps**

1. **If no clear input provided, ask what they want to build**

   Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** (open-ended, no preset options) to ask:

   > "What change do you want to work on? Describe what you want to build or fix."

   From their description, derive a kebab-case name (e.g., "add user authentication" → `add-user-auth`).

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT proceed without understanding what the user wants to build.

2. **Create the change directory**

   ```bash
   openspec new change "<name>"
   ```

   This creates a scaffolded change at `openspec/changes/<name>/` with `.openspec.yaml` using the **default schema** from `openspec/config.yaml` — **`experiment-hub-lite`**. Take the default; do not offer a schema menu. The single override is `--schema bhd-experiment`, and only when the experiment's hub detail page should render phase tabs (see `rules/openspec-workflow.mdc`).

3. **Get the artifact build order**

   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```

   Parse the JSON to get:
   - `applyRequires`: array of artifact IDs needed before implementation (e.g., `["tasks"]`)
   - `artifacts`: list of all artifacts with their status and dependencies

4. **Lite schema gate (when `schemaName` is `experiment-hub-lite`)**

   Before creating `proposal`:
   - Require **Human anchor** — founder quote verbatim (paste or `experiments/<slug>/docs/intent.md`). If missing, use **AskUserQuestion** to collect it; do not invent anchor-only prose.
   - **One artifact per user turn:** create only the next `ready` artifact, show it, **stop and wait for approval** before the next (do not batch proposal + specs + design + tasks in one response).

4b. **BHD schema gate (when `schemaName` is `bhd-experiment`)**

- Read store paths from `openspec/config.yaml` and `rules/bhd-experiment.mdc`. If a store file is missing, say so and use template placeholders.
- **One artifact per user turn:** create only the next `ready` artifact (`explore` → `propose` → `apply` → `archive`), show it, **stop and wait for approval** before the next.
- **Never** create `proposal.md`, `specs/**/*.md`, `design.md`, or `tasks.md` on this change.
- **`explore`:** Strategic Why (or intentional blank), proxy user if needed, permutations, M/P/S score profile per `rules/scoring-criteria.mdc`. Link `experiments/<slug>/docs/market-research.md` when present.
- **`propose`:** After draft, prompt re-score vs Explore (deltas). Link `experiments/<slug>/docs/business-case.md` when present.
- **`apply`:** Build Units only — remind that `/opsx:apply` for code uses a **child** lite change.
- Optional: sync scorecard to `data/experiments.json` only when user asks (not automated).
- **Hub registry (explore artifact):** When creating the first BHD artifact for change `<id>`, verify `data/experiments.json` has a row with matching `id` (or `openspecChangeId`) and `experiments/<id>/docs/` exists. If missing, tell the user and offer to register via `@experiment-creator` before continuing — list row links to `/experiments/<id>`; Lifecycle tab reads `openspec/changes/<id>/`.

5. **Create artifacts in sequence until apply-ready**

   Use the **TodoWrite tool** to track progress through the artifacts.

   **Lite or BHD:** stop after each artifact (steps 4 / 4b). **Other schemas:** loop until all `applyRequires` artifacts are done.

   Loop through artifacts in dependency order (artifacts with no pending dependencies first):

   a. **For each artifact that is `ready` (dependencies satisfied)**:
   - Get instructions:
     ```bash
     openspec instructions <artifact-id> --change "<name>" --json
     ```
   - The instructions JSON includes:
     - `context`: Project background (constraints for you - do NOT include in output)
     - `rules`: Artifact-specific rules (constraints for you - do NOT include in output)
     - `template`: The structure to use for your output file
     - `instruction`: Schema-specific guidance for this artifact type
     - `outputPath`: Where to write the artifact
     - `dependencies`: Completed artifacts to read for context
   - Read any completed dependency files for context
   - Create the artifact file using `template` as the structure
   - Apply `context` and `rules` as constraints - but do NOT copy them into the file
   - Show brief progress: "Created <artifact-id>"

   b. **Continue until all `applyRequires` artifacts are complete**
   - After creating each artifact, re-run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json`
   - Check if every artifact ID in `applyRequires` has `status: "done"` in the artifacts array
   - Stop when all `applyRequires` artifacts are done

   c. **If an artifact requires user input** (unclear context):
   - Use **AskUserQuestion tool** to clarify
   - Then continue with creation

6. **Show final status**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>"
   ```

**Output**

After completing all artifacts, summarize:

- Change name and location
- List of artifacts created with brief descriptions
- What's ready: "All artifacts created! Ready for implementation."
- Prompt: For **experiment-hub-lite** — "Run `/opsx:apply` to implement tasks." For **bhd-experiment** — "Use a child change (`--schema experiment-hub-lite`) for code, or update Build Units in `apply.md`; parent `/opsx:apply` does not run task checkboxes."

**Artifacts output (required):** Follow [`skills/openspec-artifacts-output.md`](openspec-artifacts-output.md). After **each** artifact write (lite: every approval turn), end the message with `## Artifacts` linking files touched that turn. When all `applyRequires` artifacts are `done`, list every artifact file for the change (from `openspec status --change "<name>" --json`).

**Artifact Creation Guidelines**

- Follow the `instruction` field from `openspec instructions` for each artifact type
- The schema defines what each artifact should contain - follow it
- Read dependency artifacts for context before creating new ones
- Use `template` as the structure for your output file - fill in its sections
- **IMPORTANT**: `context` and `rules` are constraints for YOU, not content for the file
  - Do NOT copy `<context>`, `<rules>`, `<project_context>` blocks into the artifact
  - These guide what you write, but should never appear in the output

**Guardrails**

- **experiment-hub-lite:** Human anchor non-empty; max 2 capabilities in proposal; max 5 requirements in specs; one artifact per approval; load `skills/<skill>.md` per schema `instruction` in `openspec instructions` JSON
- **bhd-experiment:** one artifact per approval; follow `rules/bhd-experiment.mdc`; no lite artifacts on the same change
- Create ALL artifacts needed for implementation (as defined by schema's `apply.requires`)
- Always read dependency artifacts before creating a new one
- If context is critically unclear, ask the user - but prefer making reasonable decisions to keep momentum
- If a change with that name already exists, ask if user wants to continue it or create a new one
- Verify each artifact file exists after writing before proceeding to next
